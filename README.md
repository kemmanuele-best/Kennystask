Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software codes.
Git is a free, open source version control tool that developers install locally on their personal computers, while GitHub is a pay-for-use online service built to run Git in the cloud.
Three alternatives to github include; gitbucket, gitlab and harnes.
Git pull copies changes fron a remote repository directly into your working directory, while git pull doesn't.
Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. And the code is git rebase <branch-name>
git cherry-pick is a command that allows you to apply a specific commit from one branch onto another branch. Itâ€™s useful when you want to incorporate a particular commit (or a few commits) from one branch without merging the entire branch.
The code for git cherry-pick is <commit-hash>
